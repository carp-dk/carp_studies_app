    "ic.tasks.content": "We aim to improve assessment and psychotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents through digital tools for patients, parents, and therapists. \n\nWe aim to give an innovative push to public sector hospitals and research by integrating wearable sensors and machine learning techniques. This project's results will also advance research in computational science and psychiatry by testing biomarkers of clinical relevance.\n\nIn this study, we will test the feasibility of implementing digitally enhanced psychotherapy and research in a community child and adolescent mental health center, including mobile and wearable devices' acceptability to patients, parents, and therapists.\n\nStudy tasks include (1) daily surveys to register emotional states (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) and distress levels before and after exposure practice, and (2) weekly surveys to measure symptoms, acceptability, trust and user experience with the wristband and the study app.\n\nData collected from this study will be analyzed and shared by researchers at DTU and medical researchers in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center. Results from this study will be published in an anonymized format in scientific journals and other scientific forums and may be presented at scientific conferences. Dissemination of the research results will be completely anonymous and will NOT contain any individual-identifiable information.

  "ic.overview.content": "We invite you to participate in the CATCH Data Collection Study, focusing on identifying digital biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases through cardiac health data. Participation involves using a wearable ECG sensor and the CARP Study app for one week, five times over a year, to monitor heart rhythms, movements, sleep, and event experiences.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:\nProf. Jakob E. Bardram, MSc., PhD,\nDepartment of Health Technology,\nTechnical University of Denmark,\nRichard Pedersens Plads,\nDK-2800 Lyngby \nemail: jakba@dtu.dk\nFeel free to reach out with any questions about the study.",

This initial meeting lasts about one hour.\nSecond, use the monitoring system daily for a week. This includes wearing the ECG device continuously, reporting any health events, completing daily questions on sleep, and maintaining the device. Expect to spend around one hour daily on these tasks.\nAfter this week, store the ECG device until the next monitoring phase. You'll be reminded by phone for each of the five monitoring periods.\nFinally, participate in a closing meeting at DTU after all monitoring periods, to provide feedback and complete health surveys. This last meeting also lasts about one hour.",

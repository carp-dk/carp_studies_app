It is taken off at bedtime and charged overnight and put on again the next morning.\n\nThe wristband can store 60 hours of data. Therefore, we will meet up to 2 times a week to make room for data on the bracelet. These meetings can take place in the clinic or at your home. When you stop participation in the project, the biosensor must be returned.\n\n\nQuestionnaires:\n\nWe will also ask the child/youth and parent to answer various questionnaires. We will send an email to ebox with a link to the questionnaires. They are about emotions, family life, quality of life, and functioning in everyday life. We will ask children / youth to answer some web-based questionnaires twice: 1. at the beginning and 2. end of the course. Parents are asked to answer questionnaires three times: 1. at the beginning, 2. midway and 3. at the end of the study.\n\n\nWhen should we meet at the clinic: \n\nDuring the study period, we will ask children/youth and parents to participate in various assessments with the researchers in the clinic at the beginning and end of the study.",

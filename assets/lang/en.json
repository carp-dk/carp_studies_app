This project's results will also advance research in computational science and psychiatry by testing biomarkers of clinical relevance.\n\nIn this study, we will test the feasibility of implementing digitally enhanced psychotherapy and research in a community child and adolescent mental health centre, including mobile and wearable devices' acceptability to patients, parents, and therapists.\n\n\nStudy tasks\n\n- Daily surveys to register emotional states (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) and distress levels before and after exposure practice.\n- Weekly surveys to measure symptoms, acceptability, trust [1] and user experience [2] with the Wristband and the Study App.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

# CARP Studies App

The CARP Studies App is designed to run generic studies using the [CARP Mobile Sensing](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) (CAMS) Framework, which is part of the [Copenhagen Research Platform](https://carp.cachet.dk) (CARP) from the [Department of Health Technology](https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/) at the Technical University of Denmark.

It follows a basic Business Logic Component (BLoC) combined with a Model-View-View-Model architecture, as described in the [CARP Mobile Sensing Demo App](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/tree/master/apps/carp_mobile_sensing_app).

#CARP Study App
The CARP Study App is designed to run generic studies using the [CARP Mobile Sensing](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) 
(CAMS) Framework, which is part of the [CACHET Research Platform](https://carp.cachet.dk) (CARP) 
from the [Copenhagen Center for Health Technology](https://www.cachet.dk).

It follows the Flutter Business Logic Component (BLoC) architecture, as described in the 
[CARP Mobile Sensing Demo App](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/tree/master/apps/carp_mobile_sensing_app).
